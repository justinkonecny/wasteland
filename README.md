# Wasteland
### A text adventure for PHIL 1260

Our final project is a text-based game where the user will be set in a post-apocalyptic world where the decisions made by the player will affect the final outcome of the game. The situations encountered by the user reflects many of the themes, such as (1) moral decisions to help or harm survivors, (2) options to preserve the way of life before the apocalypse, (3) to evolve into a primal being set only on survival (Book of Eli), (4) representation of the gender divide (role of a man versus role of a woman).
